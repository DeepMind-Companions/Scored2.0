# Scored2.0
---

## Description
Scored 2.0 is a project made by 3 people to predict cricket scores and win percentages. There are many different models created (and still being created) by Muhammad Arsalan Khan, Athar Rizwan and Aun Noman.

## Usage
In order to quickly jump right into it's working, go to [scored](./Scored.ipynb) where the models are up for display.

## The Code Behind it.
Obviously, the simple model itself doesn't show what is happening on the backend. If you would like to navigate and understand the folders, follow through here:

The project is divided into 3 main folders, named [Aun](./Aun), [Athar](./Athar) and [Arsalan](./Arsalan). Even though we collaborated on our work, we made sure we work separately in order to gain different perspectives to this problem. This is clearly evident in seperate implementation of Arsalan's and Athar's models (especially when it comes to handling wide and extra balls).

**In each of these folders, there are the following READMEs that describe their individual navigation and project flow:**
- [Athar's README](./Athar/README.md)
- [Aun's README](./Aun/README.md)
- [Arsalan's README](./Arsalan/README.md)

**In theory, each of their folder is divided into 3 main folders:**
- Notebooks.
  - In notebooks, all of the code is written, both to gather and augment the data as well.
- Resources
  - Here, all the data is stored in pickle format. The data is augmented in notebooks and stored here in .pkl formal.
  - **IMPORTANT!** The Resources folder might not exist in each of their folders due to it's large size, and in order to access these, you can find their links as given below:
    - [Arsalan's Resources folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ktAqRtGnHsQh1bYuXazkxhXbYOBIbz1l?usp=drive_link)
- Models
  - Here, all the trained final models are stored. These are later accessed in order to show their working as well.

## Contributing
We would love to further work on our project as we believe a lot more can be done on it. If you are interested in contributing, please contact us [here](#contact-us) if you would like to collaborate with us.

Some ideas we believe can be used to further improve our project (most of it we will continue to work ourselves on as well):
- Deploy the model.
- Make a frontend website/app that can support our model.
- Use more data and features to get more accurate results.
- Try different types of models.

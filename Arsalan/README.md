# Scored 2.0 By Arsalan

## Description
Welcome to scored2.0 By Arsalan. The work in this folder is mostly by me, however I have deeply collaborated with Athar and Aun and took inspiration from their work as well.

## My models.
I have displayed my models in a [demo file](./Models/demo.ipynb). Navigate to it to see their working. 

## Navigation.
In order to get straight to the models I worked on, you can jump straight to the [Neural Network folder](./Notebooks/Neural%20Network/).
- Each of the notebook is ordered
- Hence it is better to navigate through them in order as it can give an insight on the model's evolution.

If you want to go through data retrieval files, their order is more complicated and explained in the [dataretrieval md file](./Notebooks/Data%20Retrieval/dataretrieval.md)
